# Neem 

Neem is a framework for automated verification of mergeable replicated data types (MRDTs) and state-based convergent replicated data types (CRDTs). See https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3720452. 

## Development Environment

Easiest way to get started is to use the devcontainer.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/prismlab/neem
$ cd neem
$ code . # Start VSCode
```

VSCode will notify that there is a devcontainer associated with this repo and whether to open this repo in a devcontainer.

Click "Reopen in Container".

Choose "from DockerHub" option. The repo will be opened in a devcontainer. This will take a while when you do it for the first time to download the Docker image. 

You can check whether everything works correctly by running 

```
$ ./verify_crdts.sh
```

to confirm that everything works fine. This will verify CRDT implementations and produce a table at the end summarising the verification time.
